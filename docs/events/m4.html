We want to capture feedback on these items, to raise awareness, and to encourage teachers and trainers to use them.</p><p>So, on <strong>Wednesday, September 13, 2023, 09:00-16:00 EEST</strong>, we are hosting a multiplier event / conference to present our approach to developing and deploying digital educational materials as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Education Resources (OER)</a>.
As part of the event, we are organizing practical workshops to get a hands-on experience of our work, and brainstorming meetings to get your input on important questions regarding the future of education in the digital age.
Our goal is to extract best practices, guides and lessons learned, in order to build up the methods, approaches and infrastructure for the future of education, a future that will be tied to digitalization and technology.</p><p>The event takes place in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8NuZ3HXr7pKTToSp7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Library of University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest</a>.</p><p>We will start with a conference style set of presentations, continue with practical workshops, have lunch and then do brainstorming sessions.
We will have coffee &amp; drinks freely available.</p><p>If you are an educator with interest in improving the quality of educational materials and the process of using them to teach, evaluate and support learning, this is an event you want to be part of.</p><p>If you plan to attend, please fill <a href="https://forms.gle/nLmRaEcYTbP7zyiC6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="schedule">Schedule<a class="hash-link" href="#schedule" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Date: Wednesday, September 13, 2023</li><li>Time: 09:00-16:00 EEST (Romania time)</li><li>Place: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8NuZ3HXr7pKTToSp7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Library of University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest</a>, 2nd floor</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="agenda">Agenda<a class="hash-link" href="#agenda" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>09:00-09:15: Welcome</li><li>09:15-10:45: Talks / Conference, room <code>2.1</code>, 2nd floor<ol><li>Open Education Hub: overview, goals, vision, values, results so far</li><li>Methodology for Open Education</li><li>Infrastructure for Open Education</li><li>Repository walkthrough</li></ol></li><li>10:45-11:15: Break: 2nd floor foyer</li><li>11:15-13:00: Workshops (bring a laptop): rooms <code>2.1</code>, <code>2.2</code>, <code>2.3</code>, <code>3.2</code><ol><li>Creating and deploying an Open Education Hub repository (room <code>2.2</code>)</li><li>Automating assignment evaluation with vmchecker (room <code>2.3</code>)</li><li>Adding linters and GitHub actions in your educational repository (room <code>2.1</code>)</li><li>Developing evaluation content with Open Education Hub (quizzes) (room <code>3.2</code>)</li></ol></li><li>13:00-14:00: Lunch: 2nd floor foyer</li><li>14:00-15:30: Brainstormings: rooms <code>2.1</code>, <code>2.2</code>, <code>2.3</code>, <code>3.2</code><ol><li>Attracting and engaging students during live activities (lecture, seminars) (room <code>2.1</code>)</li><li>Statistics and metrics for the teaching and learning processes (room <code>2.2</code>)</li><li>Using Open Education Hub methodology and infrastructure beyond Computer Science topics (room <code>2.3</code>)</li><li>Developing, maintaining and assessing assignments and projects as OERs (room <code>3.2</code>)</li></ol></li><li>15:30-16:00: Brainstorming conclusions and parting thoughts</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="open-education-hub-overview-goals-vision-values-results-so-far---răzvand">Open Education Hub: Overview, Goals, Vision, Values, Results so Far - RăzvanD<a class="hash-link" href="#open-education-hub-overview-goals-vision-values-results-so-far---răzvand" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>RD: Today we will show what we&#x27;ve done, and we&#x27;ll collect feedback from you.
How will technology affect education?
We want to make teaching great again, it should be more about mentoring, and less about repetitive tasks.</p><p>RD: There&#x27;s a lot of bureaucracy when teaching that can be automated easily.
Content development shouldn&#x27;t waste time each year, we should only improve what we have.
We want to have everything already there.</p><p>RD: We use the OER guides in this project.
We started with a few people, we gathered some more along the way and now we want to gather even more.
Iteration makes perfect.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="methodology-for-open-education---răzvann">Methodology for Open Education - RăzvanN<a class="hash-link" href="#methodology-for-open-education---răzvann" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>RN: Educational content should be free and available to everyone.
There are creators and consumers.
The methodology treats these aspects.</p><p>RN: I&#x27;ll talk about the content creation, and Sergiu will talk about the infrastructure.
One will go to the Open Education Hub GitHub and will find lectures/content about biology, history, etc.
We present guidelines on how to create content, how to update it, and how to use it.</p><p>RN: We structure content into the following: reading, media, guides, drills, slides, and projects.
Drills are simple exercises, while projects are broader.
You need to use more topics and information to solve them.</p><p>RN: We then state what content types we need to use for a specific activity.
The activities are lectures, practical sessions, assignments, self-study, tests.
The mapping can be one-to-one or one-to-many.
For example, for lectures, multiple types of content can be included (e.g. slides, media, drills, guides).</p><p>RN: Find the repository structure in the template.
We chose this structure so one can choose what chapters one would teach.
We keep the entire collection of chapters and you can choose the topics.
Ideally, a script will extract whatever you want and will publish it to a website.</p><p>RN: As for our next steps, we create these tools to do all these stuff automatically, and extend the methodology for other topics.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="infrastructure-for-open-education---sergiu">Infrastructure for Open Education - Sergiu<a class="hash-link" href="#infrastructure-for-open-education---sergiu" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>SW: Servers go brrrr.
Setting up classes takes a lot of teachers&#x27; time.
Another issue that we have is integrating feedback.</p><p>SW: Our goal is to make the teacher&#x27;s job easier.
We want to focus more on the interaction with the students, and less on setting up classes.
We want to automate everything.</p><p>SW: We want to build content that is OER.
To do this we have to have the content editable by regular users, mostly text format files: slides, tasks, assignments, quizzes.
The slide you are looking at is actually a Markdown file.</p><p>SW: The OER builder receives a configuration recipe, and the content, and it servers an HTML content.
We use HTML because it&#x27;s text and easy to host.</p><p>SW: We use Docusaurus, which converts Markdown into HTML easily.
Reveal-md generates slides from Markdown files.</p><p>SW: After building the content, we want to distribute it.
By using HTML and git, we have the advantage that this content can be viewed in the browser.
Automatic publishing is also part of this flow.
We can publish content on both GitHub and GitLab.</p><p>SW: Others will find the content and they can suggest improvements.
The suggestions come as pull requests, the owner of the repository is responsible for &quot;accepting&quot; the suggestion, but apart from that, everything is published automatically.
SW: After building and publishing the content, we need to check the students&#x27; assignments.
They need instant feedback.
So we built VMChecker.
It uses containers for easy checking.</p><p>SW: We integrated VMChecker with a familiar interface - Moodle.
Students can upload assignments via GitLab or Moodle, both of them allowing them to receive instant feedback from VMChecker on Moodle.
A teacher creates an assignment in Moodle and that&#x27;s it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="repository-walkthrough">Repository Walkthrough<a class="hash-link" href="#repository-walkthrough" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="operating-systems---teo">Operating Systems - Teo<a class="hash-link" href="#operating-systems---teo" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>TD: We have all the content in the <a href="https://GitHub.com/open-education-hub/operating-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operating Systems repository</a>.
It&#x27;s rendered <a href="https://open-education-hub.GitHub.io/operating-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using Docusaurus</a> as Sergiu has just explained.</p><p>TD: Some of the things to note about the content are first that slides are embedded into the website <a href="https://open-education-hub.GitHub.io/operating-systems/Lecture/Software-Stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like so</a>.
These slides are stored in Markdown format in the repository on GitHub and then &quot;compiled&quot; and rendered on this website so anyone can browse them.</p><p>TD: Another thing to note is related to our assignments.
We have 5 up to now and we&#x27;re planning to keep adding assignments so that at some point we may choose a given number of them at the start of the semester and use those for evaluation.
All assignments are graded via the new VMChecker that Sergiu has also touched on.</p><p>TD: Now moving back to the repository, RăzvanN told you that students are encouraged to contribute.
We award cryptocurrency rewards for this, namely SmileyCoins.
Initially, we&#x27;re doing this manually, but for tracking, we&#x27;re also assigning labels to these PRs.
Being just a token coin, the amounts we&#x27;re awarding are symbolic: 1 and 5, depending on the PR&#x27;s complexity.</p><p>RD: Keep in mind that the rendered website is produced automatically from the GitHub repository.</p><p>TD: Yes, when a contribution is made to the GitHub repository, there is an automated system in place that publishes the updated version of the website.
This way, students always have access to the most up-to-date materials.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="security-summer-school---gabi">Security Summer School - Gabi<a class="hash-link" href="#security-summer-school---gabi" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>GM: We migrated the SSS to the OpenEduHub format.
Now we&#x27;ll see a &quot;before and after&quot; comparison.
We started with the <a href="https://security.cs.pub.ro/summer-school/wiki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki page (2014-2020)</a> where we had to manage access to people that could contribute and there was no way of reviewing changes.</p><p>GM: Afterwards we switched to an intermediate format, not so different from the current Open Education format.
It used <a href="https://security-summer-school.GitHub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo, a theme for Docsy</a>.
We had some problems with rendering different types of content.</p><p>GM: Right now we have SSS on <a href="https://open-education-hub.GitHub.io/binary-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Education Hub</a>.
We follow the methodology that RăzvanN talked about, we have multiple chapters with different types of content.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="computing-and-calculus-for-advanced-statistics---eggert">Computing and Calculus for Advanced Statistics - Eggert<a class="hash-link" href="#computing-and-calculus-for-advanced-statistics---eggert" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>EKH: I teach a mostly self study course at University of Iceland.
We had this material, it was tough to maintain, the person responsible for the content is about to retire.</p><p>EKH: Our task was to take this content in LaTeX form and create Markdown from it.
We thought about using automatic conversion tools from LaTeX to Markdown, but each tool we tried required a lot of configuration.</p><p>EKH: Originally, students created parts of this content, each had a different style, different structure, some had images.
EKH: After lots of trials, we <a href="https://open-education-hub.GitHub.io/ccas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got it to work</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="questions">Questions<a class="hash-link" href="#questions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Marius: Is there a nicer looking content already available?</p><p>GM: We have something nicer in the <a href="https://open-education-hub.GitHub.io/operating-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operating Systems course</a>.</p><hr><p>Marius: Can you for example modify the background?</p><p>RD: Yes.
We will integrate all sorts of renderers that allow this.
We didn&#x27;t have the time yet for this.</p><hr><p>Cătălin: Do you have the option to change the theme?</p><p>RD: Yes, <code>reveal-md</code> allows this.
We propose here more of a methodology, the outcome itself is now not the best it can be, but it works.
We can make it look prettier.</p><hr><p>Cătălin: Will the system support raw HTML?</p><p>RD: Yes.</p><hr><p>Dragoș: Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a student, the teacher created a content, can I download the content?</p><p>RD: Yes, everything is in a repository.</p><hr><p>Bogdan: What you presented are entire courses.
Could it work for some educational content (not an entire course).</p><p>RD: There is going to be a central repository that contains all of them.
Afterwards you make a copy/fork and take the course.
Any sort of teaching content should be here.
The process should apply anywhere.
Children, highschool teachers, trainers, anybody.
Based on the config, you choose what to extract from an entire topic.</p><hr><p>Costin Carabaș: Do you have support for different languages?</p><p>RD: Not currently, we want the content to be internationalizable.
Now it&#x27;s in English because it was the most appropriate one to start with.
Some might complain about this, but in the future, we will make all items internationalizable.</p><hr><p>Adi Stanciu: How do you cover overlapping content?
RD: It&#x27;s not obvious.
Someone should not create a new class simply because you want things differently there.
On the other hand, if you need content from multiple classes, you specify this in the config.</p><p>Adi Stanciu: How do you help teachers select the proper content for the class?
Let&#x27;s say you have content, different levels of detail, and conflicting ideas.</p><p>RN: The idea here is that you have the chapters organized on topics.
You go on the topics, you have more reading files, drills for them and select the ones that are fit for you.</p><hr><p>Lucian: How much time did it take to migrate the OS content to this format?
Maybe this could benefit from automation.</p><p>RN: It&#x27;s hard to tell because we didn&#x27;t have all the content and then we deployed.
We built the content from zero, so it&#x27;s different.
It&#x27;s not publishing the content that is complicated.
The most time-consuming part is to think through new ideas and how to structure things, what to add, what to remove, what to avoid, and how to make it better.</p><hr><p>Radu: How does this format handle team assignments?</p><p>RN: Only one can submit.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="workshops">Workshops<a class="hash-link" href="#workshops" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="creating-and-deploying-an-open-education-hub-repository---vlad">Creating and Deploying an Open Education Hub Repository - Vlad<a class="hash-link" href="#creating-and-deploying-an-open-education-hub-repository---vlad" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>VN: Issues arose for the participants using Windows.
The suggestion was to add a section on the <code>oer-template</code> repository for instructions on how to use Docker Desktop with WSL on Windows in order to develop content.</p><p>VN: There was also a question about LaTeX support for math classes, but that is already covered in the <code>openedu-builder</code>.</p><p>VN: There were some questions about self-hosting the generated content behind a reverse proxy (Nginx / Apache).
Since the output is a static website, it can be pulled from the GitHub repository and put behind a reverse proxy (or the content can be built locally and published).</p><p>RD: Infrastructure is useful to be used outside the educational environments.
There were people who were looking to easily update their website.
It’s a non-trivial problem to do website updates.
You could go for wikis (but they are rather content centric).
Static site generators (SSGs) such as Docusaurus (see list here: <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://jamstack.org/generators/</a>) are very useful for this.
And they can be easily backed by GitHub, i.e. using the collaborative model.</p><p>RD: People will not work with Git in the command-line.
But the Git web interface is excellent for editing.
A flow that isn’t concerned with Git, but a web interface or overlay on top of Git would be good.</p><p>RD: Based on the point above, we need “tooling” - interfaces that ease up the creation, management and update of content sites (not necessarily educational).
Quite a lot of people would benefit from</p><ol><li><p>being able to do it (it’s not that easy),</p></li><li><p>having the benefits of Git / GitHub, collaboration, version control, multiple items, reviews.</p></li></ol><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="automating-assignment-evaluation-with-vmchecker---mihai">Automating Assignment Evaluation with VMChecker - Mihai<a class="hash-link" href="#automating-assignment-evaluation-with-vmchecker---mihai" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>MB: Before the presentation, I was asked if there are any actual examples of assignments that were used in production.

Other platforms might require a different format (e.g Moodle requires Moodle XML) for the questions, so we want to provide a simple script that can convert between some known and used formats.</p><p>Vlad Traistă-Popescu: Does this script support images?
SJ: No, not yet.</p><p>Vlad Traistă-Popescu: We did something similar, it uploads the image as `base64`` and Moodle knows how to handle those.</p><p>Multiple types of questions (not just multichoice) should be supported.</p><p>The workflow is still quite technical (cloning a repository, running a python script, importing stuff into Moodle).

The main topics we will discuss will be about:</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="collecting-metrics-and-feedback">Collecting Metrics and Feedback<a class="hash-link" href="#collecting-metrics-and-feedback" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>At the most fundamental level, the gradebook serves as the primary form of feedback, indicating how well students are performing academically.</p><p>In addition to grades, one approach to get insight on how well the subject is going is to implement an end-of-year feedback form that allows students to express their overall satisfaction or agreement with the subject or course.
This feedback form can be a valuable tool for gathering qualitative insights into students&#x27; experiences, opinions, and perceptions of the subject matter and the educational approach.</p><p>In addition to the annual feedback forms, setting up weekly feedback forms is essential to promptly capture immediate or &quot;real-time&quot; feedback.
These forms serve as an effective means to detect moments when students may lose interest or encounter difficulties in comprehending the course materials:</p><ul><li>Brief and Focused: limit the questions to 3-4 to encourage completion.</li><li>Direct Questions: use closed-ended questions to save time.</li><li>Optional Expression: forms are a way for students to share thoughts and are not mandatory metrics.</li></ul><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="processing-feedback">Processing Feedback<a class="hash-link" href="#processing-feedback" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Raw feedback isn&#x27;t always ideal because it can be emotionally charged, potentially affecting you personally.
One approach to address this is to have a third party review and filter out aggressive or non-constructive feedback, leaving behind only valuable suggestions for improvement.</p><p>However, this filtering process can result in a loss of information, making it harder for you to fully comprehend certain opinions.
To address this, consider providing students with the option to include their email addresses in the feedback form.
This enables you to reach out to them later for clarification and a deeper understanding of their perspective.</p><p>In essence, this approach closes the feedback loop and encourages engaged students to contribute more effectively by facilitating a two-way conversation for better communication and comprehension of their feedback.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="using-metrics">Using Metrics<a class="hash-link" href="#using-metrics" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Analyzing correlations between feedback and grades can provide valuable insights into necessary changes:
When students who have received lower grades in specific areas consistently provide similar feedback, it signals potential deficiencies in the educational materials for those areas.
When students with high grades also provide positive feedback, it suggests that increasing engagement for other students may be beneficial.
Conversely, if most students express positive assessments of the subject but exhibit divergent grades, it raises the possibility that the provided materials may not be sufficient for a complete understanding of the concepts.</p><p>Feedback itself can be used as a transparency tool.
This involves sharing with students the ideas and suggestions provided by previous student cohorts and engaging in discussions about the improvements that have been made in response to this feedback.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="using-the-open-education-hub-methodology-and-infrastructure-beyond-computer-science-topics---răzvann">Using the Open Education Hub Methodology and Infrastructure Beyond Computer Science Topics - RăzvanN<a class="hash-link" href="#using-the-open-education-hub-methodology-and-infrastructure-beyond-computer-science-topics---răzvann" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>One person attended, a professor from a Faculty of Geography.
He is teaching a course on creating and using maps (physical and digital) to students that don’t have a background in computer science or using programming tools such as git.
He was very interested in how the methodology can be applied in his case, given that there are multiple universities that teach such a course, each with its own version of teaching materials.
Using the our methodology to develop education materials for such a course would bring great benefits to both the teachers of the course (they can share maps which are not easily found on the internet and are hard to update) and the students (that can access older versions of the maps that are being presented).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="takeaways">Takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="open-education-hub-repository---vlad">Open Education Hub Repository -
